<p>Unlike the standard AMV competition, there are no themes/genres. This means that to enter this tournament, you can make any short AMVs you want in any genre you like! As long as it is something that you make that would interest the judges, then you be on your way to tournament! If you do succeed in the qualifying round, then themes will be provided to you and your opponent in that round. As you progress, the themes you encounter will become difficult. The winner of the tournament will be the one who goes through all the rounds and wins the Grand Final!</p>
